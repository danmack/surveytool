# a Multi User Survey Tool

This tool is a prototype multi user survey tool using a curses
interface meant to conduct a surveys and collect the results after
which, the results would be summarized for some purpose.  The person
in the conductor role would create the surveys in the survey
description language (included), compile the survey, and then deploy
it to hundreds to thousands of users who are able to mount the same
NFS server hierarchy.

This project served a purpose in 1993 but was only used in production
once.  For archeological reasons this has been resurrected and put
into GitHub.  There is no real security or highly impressive coding
here.  I will probably modernize this for fun the next time I am on
sabbatical.

Enjoy,

Dan
