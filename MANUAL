Creating a Survey

  Survey's are described with the Survey Description Language (SDL).  SDL is a
  very simple language that resembles lisp.  Once a survey is 'coded' in SDL,
  the file containing it is compiled using the 'scc' command.  This creates a
  file called survey.out which the survey tool eventually uses to execute the
  survey.

  Here is a very simple, 1 question survey:

	#
	# sharps are comments
	#

	# blank lines are ignored

	# 1st, name the survey, write the name 
	# enclosed in quotes

	(survey "Happy or not Survey")

	# next, a list of queries is listed

	# a query takes the form of
	# (query STRING
	#  (question STRING)
	#  (answer ATYPE [ATYPE MODIFIER] [CHOICES...]))
	#
	# If ATYPE is either of CHOICE or RANK
	(query "Are you Happy"
	 (question
	"Rumor has it that you are not happy.  How happy
	are you exactly ?")
	 (answer CHOOSE 1
	  ("Incredibly") ("Very") ("Somewhat") ("Your not happy")))

  After typing this in, we compile it:

	% scc happy.sdl
	wrote 1773708 bytes to survey.out
	write returned 1773708, open returned 4
	% survey
